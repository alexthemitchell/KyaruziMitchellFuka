Assumption: We are given a set of key words

* defined set of key words (by question authors/machine learning?)
  * Pre-compile
    * Add phonetic-allowable words (library?)
    * Add typo-allowable words (Keyword Typo Generator)
    * Add all the 
* Load trie dictionary (already implemented in Swift)
  * Super fast lookups
* Remove Stopwords (filter from stopword list)
* Try each word
* Sum actions for each word
* Give probability based on % of total actions


func actionsForInput(input: String) {
  let actions = [Action : UInt]()
  for word in input {
    let action: Action? = dictionary[word]
  }
  let probabilities = [Action : Double]()
  let sum = actions.values.sum

  for (action, count) in actions {
    probabilities[action] = Double(count) / Double(sum)
  }
  return probabilities
}
