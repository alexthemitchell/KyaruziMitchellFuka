Based on Fuka's Examples, we have determined the following range of input is appropriate:
"I don't know" --> Help
"I don't even care anymore" --> Unrecognized Method
"Just a guess" --> Help
"I'll try completing the square" --> Complete The Square
"What about if I completed the square" --> Complete The Square
"I listened to John, he told me to complete the square" --> Complete The Square
"I might use the subtitutittiion method" --> Substitution
"Quadratic Formula Square Completion" --> Help

Using our probabilities, we will set a threshold (atleast 50%) where input that is under that is either Unrecognized or Help
